[![animated-phone-stack.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wxy0q913/animated-phone-stack.png)](https://postimg.cc/grpv4FqP)

This React component can be inserted into any website to create a perfect showcase of your mobile designs for the user to interact with.

I originally created this to showcase my Front-End Development knowledge and showcase my mobile designs. 

All that is required to use this in your portfolio is to replace the images in the folder with ones of your choosing, and import src/components/molecules/PhoneStack.js and PhoneStack.css into your project.
